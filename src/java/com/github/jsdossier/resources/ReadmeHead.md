# Dossier

Dossier is a [JSDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc) parsing tool built on
top of the [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/).
Dossier uses the compiler to parse your code and build a type graph. It then
traverses the graph to find types to generate documentation for. Proper use of
Closure's [annotations](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler)
will not only improve the type-checking and optimizations of the Closure
Compiler, but will also improve Dossier's ability to generate meaningful documentation.

## Usage

    java -jar dossier.jar -c config.json

Where `config.json` is a configuration file with the options listed below.
